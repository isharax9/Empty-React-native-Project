# Creating a Blank Expo Project

## Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed on your system.

## Steps:

### 1. Create a new project:

```bash
npx create-expo-app app2 --template blank
```

This command creates a new Expo project named `app2` with a blank template, which installs the minimum required libraries.

### 2. Start the development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will start a development server and provide a QR code for scanning with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

## Additional Notes:
- You can customize the project name by replacing `app2` with your desired name.
- For more advanced project templates, explore other options available with the `npx create-expo-app` command.

## Using Expo Go:
Scan the QR code from the development server with the Expo Go app on your mobile device to view and interact with your project.

Expo Go provides a convenient way to test your app on different platforms without the need for native development environments.
